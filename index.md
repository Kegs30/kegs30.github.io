# Sheep and Wolves Model

## A variation of an agent based model

The Sheep and Wolves Model is a Python model simulating the behaviour of a flock of sheep and a pack of wolves in a field.
The sheep interact with each other and their environment, which is based on a raster file in text format.
The sheep eat the environment, share their food with each other and produce lambs.
The sheep population is controlled by the wolves, which hunt and eat the sheep.

There is an option to save the altered environment as a comma delimited text file.
